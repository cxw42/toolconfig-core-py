# Contributing to toolconfig-core-py

Thank you!!

## Basics

* `pytest` for testing
* `black` for pretty-printing
* Python's `build` module and `setuptools` for building
* `sphinx` for documentation

`Makefile` gives you convenient access to common development commands.

## Workflow

Setup: `make init`

Then:

1. Write pytest tests in `tests/`
2. Hack hack!
3. `make test`
4. Commit

Before opening a PR, please also:

1. `make prettyprint`
2. `make cover`
3. `make html` and make sure there are no errors/warnings

### Documentation

Docstrings are in [Google format], and documentation is generated using Sphinx.

`make html` will generate the docs in `doc/build/html/` (and open them, on
systems having xdg-open).

### Code coverage

`make cover` will produce a report in `cover/` (and open it on systems
having xdg-open).

## Running the CLI

```
$ PYTHONPATH=src python -m toolconfig [ARGS]...
```
or run in an [editable install].

## Please keep in mind when making changes

### Documentation

- Document using docstrings rather than comments wherever practicable.
- Class-constructor docs go in the class's docstring, not in
  `__init__()`'s docstring.
- Please do not directly edit the autogenerated .rst files in `doc/source`.
  They will be overwritten by `sphinx-apidoc`.

### Coverage

Files in `tests/` must have 100% coverage from `make cover`.  Files in
`src` should have as high a test coverage as is practicable.
